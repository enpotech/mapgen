# mapgen

work in progress

# To do:

Refactor to use Coperinicus/Landsat/ESA data as initial version focussing on european maps.  Investigate EA DEMs for UK - these are LIDAR and may be too fine as include buildings in the imagery.  Also look at countyr specific data available under open license - IE, FR etc.

Landsat is also available for US, but NAIP maybe more reliable better as used for agriculture.  USGS DEMs are also available with greater resolution.

Look into ArcGIS data if this is available under an open license - the APIs allow viewing may not allow download.

Could also use Google Earth Engine; link for testing image collection to image for download is: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/295705/image-collection-to-single-image-in-google-earth-engine
